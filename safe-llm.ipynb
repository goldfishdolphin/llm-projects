      "Okay, I need to edit this announcement from the HR department to make it more natural and supportive. Let me start by reading through the original message to understand the key points and the tone. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, the original is quite blunt and has a negative tone. Words like \"issues,\" \"do not argue,\" \"hiding things,\" and \"Try not to make more problems\" could come off as harsh. My task is to soften that while maintaining clarity. \n",
      "\n",
      "The subject line and greeting are formal. I'll keep the structure but maybe make the subject lines friendlier. Instead of \"Important information for all employees,\" perhaps \"Important Updates for All Employees ‚ú®\" with an emoji to add some positivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The salutation is \"Dear workers,\" which might be better as \"Dear Hogsmith Team\" to feel more inclusive and team-oriented. Adding a friendly opening line could help, like \"We hope you‚Äôre all having a spellbinding start to the term! üåü\" The emoji here adds a bit of lightness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first paragraph mentions the school being under Albus dumbledore's leadership and that rules sometimes feel disregarded. The original is a bit negative, so maybe rephrase to acknowledge the dynamic while emphasizing responsibility. Instead of \"still under the leadership...rules do not apply here,\" I could say \"we‚Äôre fortunate to operate under Albus dumbledore‚Äôs leadership, balancing creativity with our shared responsibilities.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the Ministry of Magic is coming for an inspection. The original uses \"do not argue\" which is too harsh. Instead, stress cooperation: \"This is a routine but essential process, and we appreciate your cooperation.\" Instead of \"hiding things,\" say \"please ensure any restricted items are properly stored.\" Adding a üßπ emoji could reference cleaning up, and üéì for inspections.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second point about House-Elves experiments uses strong language like \"This is not allowed!\" I'll soften it by starting with a reminder of commitment to ethical practices, then the consequence. \"Violations may lead to formal documentation\" sounds more professional than \"write reports.\" Throw in a üêæ emoji since House-Elves are involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The closing in the original is abrupt. Instead of \"This is all,\" use a thank you and a positive note. Maybe \"Thank you for your attention and dedication to keeping Hogsmith extraordinary! ‚ú®\" and end with a warm sign-off. Adding emojis like üè∞ and üñãÔ∏è to the signature line could add character.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, every edit should aim to be supportive, using positive language and emojis to lighten the tone. Making the message collaborative rather than dictatorial. Check for flow, clarity, and that all key points are included but presented in a friendlier manner.\n",

      "1. **Tone & Warmth**:  \n",

      "   - Replaced harsh directives (*‚Äúdo not argue,‚Äù ‚Äútry not to make more problems‚Äù*) with collaborative language (*‚ÄúYour cooperation,‚Äù ‚ÄúTogether, we‚Äôll ace this‚Äù*).  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarity & Positivity**:  \n",
      "   - Simplified bureaucratic jargon (*‚Äúrequirement‚Äù ‚ûî ‚Äúroutine process‚Äù*).  \n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Humor & Relatability**:  \n",
      "   - Playful nods to Hogsmith‚Äôs quirks (*‚Äúdungeons,‚Äù ‚Äúparchmentwork‚Äù*) balance formality with the school‚Äôs whimsical setting.  \n",
