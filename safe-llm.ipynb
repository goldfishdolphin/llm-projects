      "|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|\n",
      "| “Dear workers of Hogsmith state secondary school,” | “Dear Hogwarts team,” | Uses a respectful, inclusive term (“team”) and corrects capitalization. |\n",
      "| Vague, informal phrasing (“We must inform you of many issues which are now of importance.”) | Clear introductory sentence that states the purpose and invites questions. | Sets a friendly tone and clarifies intent. |\n",
      "| “still under the leadership of Albus dumbledore, even if sometimes it feels like rules do not apply here.” | Removed this line entirely. | Reference to “Albus dumbledore” was confusing and unprofessional for a workplace memo. |\n",
      "| “Ministry of Magic keeps reminding us, we have responsibilities, and therefore you must pay attention.” | Consolidated into a concise bullet‑point with date, purpose, and actionable steps. | Improves readability and provides concrete guidance. |\n",
      "| “They will be in all classrooms and dungeons.” | Changed to “All classrooms (and any other workspaces).” | “Dungeons” is inappropriate for a school setting; the revision stays professional. |\n",
      "| “If you are hiding things you should not have, better to do something about it now, before they see.” | Re‑phrased as “Remove any items that do not belong in a teaching environment” and offered help. | Moves from accusatory language to supportive instruction. |\n",
      "| “regarding House‑Elves… some staff are using them in magical experiments. This is not allowed!” | Re‑written to explain policy, list prohibited behavior, and give a clear contact point. | Provides clarity, removes a hostile tone, and encourages staff to ask questions. |\n",
      "| “This is all. Try not to make more problems.” | Replaced with a positive closing that thanks staff and encourages cooperation. | Leaves readers with a constructive, appreciative impression. |\n",
      "| Lack of visual cues | Added emojis (📢, ✅, 🧙‍♂️, 📊, 🧹, 🙏, ✨) and bullet points. | Emojis make the memo feel more engaging without sacrificing professionalism. |\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the revised announcement uses clear, courteous language, organizes information in easy‑to‑scan sections, and adds a supportive tone—all while keeping the essential details intact.\n"

      "Okay, I need to edit this announcement from the HR department to make it more natural and supportive. Let me start by reading through the original message to understand the key points and the tone. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, the original is quite blunt and has a negative tone. Words like \"issues,\" \"do not argue,\" \"hiding things,\" and \"Try not to make more problems\" could come off as harsh. My task is to soften that while maintaining clarity. \n",
      "\n",
      "The subject line and greeting are formal. I'll keep the structure but maybe make the subject lines friendlier. Instead of \"Important information for all employees,\" perhaps \"Important Updates for All Employees ✨\" with an emoji to add some positivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The salutation is \"Dear workers,\" which might be better as \"Dear Hogsmith Team\" to feel more inclusive and team-oriented. Adding a friendly opening line could help, like \"We hope you’re all having a spellbinding start to the term! 🌟\" The emoji here adds a bit of lightness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first paragraph mentions the school being under Albus dumbledore's leadership and that rules sometimes feel disregarded. The original is a bit negative, so maybe rephrase to acknowledge the dynamic while emphasizing responsibility. Instead of \"still under the leadership...rules do not apply here,\" I could say \"we’re fortunate to operate under Albus dumbledore’s leadership, balancing creativity with our shared responsibilities.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the Ministry of Magic is coming for an inspection. The original uses \"do not argue\" which is too harsh. Instead, stress cooperation: \"This is a routine but essential process, and we appreciate your cooperation.\" Instead of \"hiding things,\" say \"please ensure any restricted items are properly stored.\" Adding a 🧹 emoji could reference cleaning up, and 🎓 for inspections.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second point about House-Elves experiments uses strong language like \"This is not allowed!\" I'll soften it by starting with a reminder of commitment to ethical practices, then the consequence. \"Violations may lead to formal documentation\" sounds more professional than \"write reports.\" Throw in a 🐾 emoji since House-Elves are involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The closing in the original is abrupt. Instead of \"This is all,\" use a thank you and a positive note. Maybe \"Thank you for your attention and dedication to keeping Hogsmith extraordinary! ✨\" and end with a warm sign-off. Adding emojis like 🏰 and 🖋️ to the signature line could add character.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, every edit should aim to be supportive, using positive language and emojis to lighten the tone. Making the message collaborative rather than dictatorial. Check for flow, clarity, and that all key points are included but presented in a friendlier manner.\n",
